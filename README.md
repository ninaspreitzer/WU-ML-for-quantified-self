# WU: Machine Learning for the quantified self
The exercises include the following topics: 

* Sensory data (+ case study) 
* Handling noise 
* Feature extraction 
* Clustering 
* Theoretical foundations 


## Homework 1
Creating own dataset for the quantified self by using the smartphone App phybox. Result was   six different measurements by performing four kinds of activities. After performing the experiment and  the dataset was preprocessed by using R Studios. Three different step sizes (Delta t) are used to monitor the differences of the spread of the data.

## Homework 2
Measuring two different kind of activities are measured (sitting and walking). Amining to find measurement errors, but not removing correctly collected extreme measures. A few different approaches to detect noise are used. 

## Homework 3 
Focusing on clustering the collected measurements. Clustering is performed with two non-hierarchical algorithms k-means, k-medios and one hierarchical clustering with an agglomerative approach.
